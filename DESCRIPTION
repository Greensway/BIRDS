Description: A set of tools to review and make decisions upon the use of
   biodiversity data. This R package helps making the evaluation and preparation 
   of biodiversity data easy, systematic and reproducible. It also helps the users
   to overlay the point observations into a custom grid that is useful for further
   analysis. The review summarise statistics that helps evaluate whether a set 
   of species observations is fit-for-use and take decisions upon its use of on
   further analyses. It does so by quantifying the sampling effort (amount of 
   effort expended during an event) and data completeness (data gaps) to help 
   judge whether the data is representative, valid and fit for any intended 
   purpose. The `BIRDS` package is most useful when working with heterogeneous 
   data sets with variation in the sampling process, i.e. where data have been 
   collected and reported in various ways and therefore varying in sampling effort 
   and data completeness (i.e. how well the reported observations describe the 
   “true” state). Primary biodiversity data (PBD) combining data from different 
   data sets, like e.g. GBIF mediated data, commonly vary in the ways data has 
   been generated - containing opportunistically collected presence-only data 
   toghether with and data from systematic monitoring programs. The set of tools
   provided is aimed at understanding the process that generated the data (i.e. 
   observing, recording and reporting species into databases).
