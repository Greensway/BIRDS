<p>The use of the package is very simple but requires knowledge of a few concepts and making decisions regarding a few assumptions, that we will cover shortly. The use of is package starts off with a data table with one species observation per row (primary biodiversity data, PBD). As you may already know the minimum fields each observation must have to be a legitimate species observation are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>geographical coordinates<br>
</li>
<li>a date<br>
</li>
<li>a species identification<br>
</li>
<li>and hopefully the name of the observer/s (this requirement varies for different biodiversity databases)</li>
</ol>
<p>Apart from this, biodiversity databases require a plethora of variables and metadata, often following the <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/">DarwinCore</a> standard. This package recognises as a default the column names of DarwinCore, but other names can be specified too.</p>
<p>Before using the BIRDS package we already have to make some first decisions which data to retrieve and how, and whether to clean the data, as shown in this workflow <img src="images/BIRDsDecision.png" alt="Decision workflow">. The user can download the primary biodiversity data from their database of choice, import it into R. Data can be cleaned when considered necessary. As mentioned in the package description, the tools provided by the <code>BIRDS</code> package <strong>do not</strong> correct or improve the accuracy of the data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Reference species group</strong><br>
Because visits result from the sampling process they can only be defined for a reference species group, i.e. a group of species observed and recorded by similar methods. The rationale for a reference species group is based on the assumption that species groups share similar bias: we assume that, despite varying field skills and accuracy, observers reporting observations for species of a reference species group share similar observer behaviour and methods and, hence, generate data with similar sampling bias (Phillips et al. 2009). From this we can assume that the larger the number of visits (or observations) reporting species from the reference group at a specific unit of space and time, the more likely it is that the lack of visits for (or observations of) a particular species reflects the absence of (or failure to detect) a focal species rather than a lack of visits and reports made.<br>
It is important to keep in mind that, to keep the sampling bias consistent, the reference species group should only include species that are assumed to be sampled with the same methodology (Ponder et al. 2001). For example, a reference group should not include all species in the Order Lepidoptera because butterflies sensu stricto (superfamily Papilionoidea) are sampled in very different ways than most other species of Lepidoptera (mainly moths).</p>

<div id="organising-the-data" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#organising-the-data" class="anchor"></a>Organising the data</h4>
<p>Once the data is in R as a <code>data.frame</code> and loaded the package BIRDS, the fun begins. The function <code><a href="../reference/organizeBirds.html">organiseBirds()</a></code> converts the <code>data.frame</code> into a <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code> using the specified coordinates. The function takes as default coordinates in geodesic WGS84 (epsg:4326), but other can be used too. It also adds to each observation a unique identifier for the assumed <em>visit</em> (sampling event) it belongs to, given some input parameters. There are a few options here depending on the variables included in the data set, but the default is the unique combination of “locality”, “day”, “month”, “year”, and “recordedBy”. Alternatives could be a known “eventID”, or using the “rightsHolder” instead of the recorder, if that matches the reality and better helps to identify unique visits. The overall idea is to separate unique sample units, i.e. a transect, a square, a combination of point samples, or a random walk along the river side. If you lack a clear spatial definition of a visit, there are a few things you can do in the next steps (visit exploration and summary).</p>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/organizeBirds.html">organiseBirds()</a></code> function will also help to keep those observation that are useful to you based on the level of taxonomical resolution or taxon rank (the level to which each species was identified). Sometimes, observers can only identify the species up to genus, but these obsesrvations are not always helping our analyses. Then, you can define wich “taxonRank” should be kept specifying the column that should be read and the ranks to be kept. As default everything with species identifications or lower are kept (varietals and subspecies). At the same time, you may not want to differentiate among subspecies, because you know, accuracy can get shaky. Then, you can opt to simplify the names by removing all epithets and author names.</p>
<p>The result is a <code>SpatialPointsDataFrame</code> wrapped into an object of class OrganizedBirds, with additional information. To save memory, only a few columns that will be used later are kept.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Field visit</strong><br>
A central concept used by the <code>BIRDS</code> package is the “visit” – defining the sampling unit as a sampling event by a unique observer (or group of observers), at a unique unit of space and time (commonly a day). Visits can help us to summarise the amount of effort expended in the field. During a visit, the observer commonly samples (i.e. observes and records) species by similar methods. The sampling effort can ary among visits, with the amount of effort expended being greater when spending more time, and reporting more of the observed species. The same number of observations (records of species) at a unique unit of time and space could be made by either few observers reporting many species (greater effort by each observer) or many observers reporting few species (small effort by each observer). Using visits as sampling units allows separation of sampling effort into the effort that can be expressed through the number of visits by different observers and the effort per visit (e.g. species list length, or when available the time spent during a visit). Hence, the quality (completeness) of the data can be judged by using information for each visit and information from a collection of visits.</p>

<div id="first-exploration" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#first-exploration" class="anchor"></a>First exploration</h4>
<p>Once you have organised your data, we highly recommend to explore the data to see if the definition of the visits that you applied matches your expectations. The <code><a href="../reference/exploreVisits.html">exploreVisits()</a></code> function will summarize some statistics for each visit and return a <code>data.frame</code> with the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>day</li>
<li>month</li>
<li>year</li>
<li>nObs: number of species observations</li>
<li>SLL: species list length (i.e. the number of observed species)</li>
<li>effortDiam: the diameter of the minumum circle that covers all points (i.e. locations for species observations), in meters. This is calculated as two times the maximum distance between the centroid of all observation points and any individual observation.</li>
<li>medianDist: the median (Q2) of the distances between the centroid and the observations, in meters.</li>
<li>iqrDist: the interquartile range of the distances between the centroid the observations, in meters.</li>
<li>nOutliers: the number of observations whose distance to the centroid is considered an outlier. Ouliers are defined as distances grater than the Q3 * 1.5 (i.e. <code><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/topics/length">length(boxplot.stats(distances)$out)</a></code>as all distances are positive).</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to see, for example, if the distribution of covered area (effortDiam) matches your expectations for how much terrain an observer can cover during a typcal sampling event for species of the considered reference group.</p>
<p>You can directly plot these variables or use the suggested package <code>esquisse</code>.</p>

<div id="summarise" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#summarise" class="anchor"></a>Summarise</h4>
<p>The function <code><a href="../reference/summariseBirds.html">summariseBirds()</a></code> will overlay the organized data with a given spatial grid and create a set of objects that summarize the data spatially, temporally, spatiotemporally, and also provide other intermediate results useful for later analyses. The grid can be easily created in different ways (see figure below).</p>
<p><a href="./images/BIRDs.png">General function workflow within the <em>BIRDS</em> package</a></p>
<p>This function takes a few parameters, and with those your assumptions. The grid size becomes very important if your definition of visits lacks a good spatial constrain (i.e. column “locality”). If the accuracy of the locations is too poor or inexistent, then the the visits will be constrained by the grid cells. Therefore the size of the grid cells must be carefully thought of. If the visits will be constrained by the grid cells then grid cell size should match how much terrain an observer can cover during a typcal sampling event for species of the considered reference group. Then, the parameter “spillOver” will help you to determine whether, after the overlay of the observations to the grid, you want to keep connected the observations with the same visit ID. With this parameter you decide whether observations belonging to the same visit will be split into different grid cells when visit extent overlaps more than one grid cell, or not. That is, with <code>spillOver = TRUE</code> you decide that visits should not be split, instead the function copies into a focal grid cell all those observations falling outside the cell but belonging to visits that fall within the cell. It creates duplicates to be able to summarise complete visits (soon, we will add the option to <em>move</em> the observations to the grid cell with the most observations for the focal visit). In the best of the cases, this should not cause much bias, because one expects that only a handfull of visits lay in between two or more cells. However, if grid cell size is too small, or the visits are too loosely defined, everything will end up duplicated everywhere. On the contrary, with <code>spillOver = FALSE</code> the function will split the observations strictly to the grid cell they fall in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Spatial grid and spillover</strong><br>
Defined by a unique observer (or group of observers), at a unique unit of space and time visits can be identified by a unique combination of variables: observer id, location, time. Often location is a named unit of space that has been visited during the same sampling event. For example a botanist visiting and reporting species for a meadow, or a bird watcher visiting and reporting species for a lake.<br>
Sometimes locations can be more accurate positions for individuals of species that have been observed and reported during the same field visit. The botanist may have visited the meadow but reported species from a number of different sampling points in that meadow. Or the bird watcher reported species for different parts of the lake. In that case there is no common spatial identifier for the visit.<br>
If there is no common spatial identifier to define the visit extent, and the obverver id is not enough to constrain observations spatially (e.g. group of observers from organisation where observer id = organisation name), then visits can be created <em>when</em> overlaying the observation data with the spatial grid. A visit is then defined as all the observations falling into the same grid cell. It is important to keep in mind to choose a grid with a cell size that corresponds to (or at least is not smaller than) the average spatial extent known (or assumed) to be typical for field visits for the reference species group. This process can be repeated with a set of grids with different offset to explore the sensitivity of the results to the size of the grid cells.</p>

<p>Finally, the function <code><a href="../reference/exportBirds.html">exportBirds()</a></code> helps the user to obtain the data ready to be plotted with widely known commands for vectors and spatial data.</p>

<p>The SLL per visit (i.e. the number of species observed and recorded per visit) is a well known proxy for the time spent in the field and willingness to report all species seen of a reference taxonomic group, Szabo et al. 2010). The <code>BIRDS</code> package therefore uses SLL as a proxy for sampling effort.</p>
